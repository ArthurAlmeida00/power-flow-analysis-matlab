# Power Flow Analysis: Newton-Raphson and Fast Decoupled Methods

## Objective
This repository contains a MATLAB implementation for solving the power flow problem of a 4-bus electrical power system. The algorithm calculates voltage magnitudes and angles, active and reactive power flows, and automated system reinforcements under overload conditions.

## Mathematical Methods Implemented
1. **Newton-Raphson Method:** Utilizes an exact, dynamically built Jacobian matrix updated at each iteration for non-linear equation solving.
2. **Fast Decoupled Method:** Employs constant sub-matrices (B' and B'') derived from the admittance matrix, prioritizing computational speed while maintaining accuracy for standard high-voltage transmission networks.

## Key Features
* **Dynamic Admittance Matrix (Ybus):** Automated construction of the Ybus matrix from raw line data, incorporating both series impedance and shunt susceptance (Pi model).
* **Iterative Solvers:** Full implementation of iterative loops with defined convergence criteria (tolerance set to 1e-6).
* **Automated Line Reinforcement:** Continuous monitoring of line apparent power flows (MVA). If a thermal limit is exceeded, the algorithm automatically proposes system reinforcement (circuit duplication) and recalculates the power flow to ensure operational stability.
* **Slack and Generator State:** Explicit calculation of active/reactive power injections at the Slack bus and reactive power supplied by PV generators.

## Usage
Run the main script in the MATLAB environment:
1. Execute `Tl_ArthurAlmeida.m`.
2. Select the preferred numerical method via the prompt (`1` for Newton-Raphson, `2` for Fast Decoupled).
3. The script will output iteration logs, final voltage states, line power flows, and alert for any topological reinforcements applied.

## Validation
The numerical results generated by this script are designed to be cross-validated against commercial power system simulation software (e.g., PowerWorld Simulator).
